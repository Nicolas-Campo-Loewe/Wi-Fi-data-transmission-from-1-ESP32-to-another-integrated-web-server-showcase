# Wi-Fi data  transmission from 1 ESP32 to another + integrated web server showcase

Brief description
- Wi-Fi connection between an ESP32 server and an ESP32 client. Basic telemetry data (temperature shown in UTC time) is sent and displayed on the web server via the ESP32 client.

Clarifications:
- Code was run on two different projects inside arduino IDE, so each microcontroller has it´s own programme and connection. The client ESP32 runs on client.ino and the host ESP32 runs on host.ino
- Code is totally free to utilize

Youtube showcase:
- The following video showcases the code in action:
